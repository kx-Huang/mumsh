# Mumsh: VE482 Operating System Project 1
This project is a course project in VE482 Operating System at UM-SJTU Joint Institute. In this project, a mini shell `mumsh` is implemented with C. `mumsh` supports some basic shell functions including a read/parse/execute loop, I/O redirection under bash style syntax, pipes, internal cmd `pwd`/`cd`/`jobs`, `CTRL-C` interruption, quotes, incomplete input waiting, syntax error handling and background jobs.

In this `README`, the following content will be included:
- how to build and run `mumsh`
- how to play with `mumsh`
- how `mumsh` is constructed
